General outline of this project:

* Need to identify which photos in the malaria data set belong to a certiain class of disease.
* This data is labeled in the malaria_image_dataset folder
* We can augment the 100 photos present to increase the training/testing size of data
* We can then create a neural network to identify which photos belong to the yes/no classification
* Essentially leveraging a classification neural net here is ideal
* This project will comprise of scripts for the following tasks:
  * Data Augmentation
  * Training a Neural Net
  * Deployment of said Neural Net on new training data
